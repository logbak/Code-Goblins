Main Goals:

-Add Exits to PrintCurrentRoom and it's child methods
--Exits print correctly on top and bottom walls
--Will need to edit all methods that print side walls:
---(PrintCurrentRoom, PrintSideWalls, PrintPlayerPosition, PrintBlockPositions, PrintSingleBlockRow)

-Add interaction switch case under PlayerControl method
--Set up trigger system using Block IsTrigger bool and PlayerControl method to run a method based on BlockID
--i.e. When the player hits the interact key "i" and they are next to a interactable block a method will run
--based on the block they are next to (for example: NPC dialog)
---This will need a way to choose between blocks if the player is next more than one interactable
--interaction methods should probably have their own repository

-Add a menu or exit switch case under PlayerControl method
--When a certain key is pressed a menu will appear with options or the game will asked if you want to exit

-Set up ProgramUI properly
--Currently only set up to run a basic map printing loop with no exit (console window must be manually closed)

-Set up a player class that holds the players current status
--i.e. level, health, inventory, etc.
--Once done interaction methods can interact with this class to progress the game

-Set up a way to lock/unlock doors based on a conditional
--This could be done by making certain GoToIDs(normally set to the RoomID the exit goes to) tied to a
--new method called inside the PlayerControl method
--Alternatively a bool could be added to the Exit class (will required editing previously made Exits/Rooms)

-Create the rest of the map and populate each room with blocks

-Set up win/lose conditions and gameplay loop.
--Ideas:
---Doing certain things will increase level and after a certain level is obtained you will win
---Player health will start at a certain level and go down with certain interactions. If it reaches 0 they will lose
---Player can regain health by taking certain actions
---Inventory items obtained could modify the gains/loses from certain interactions?
---Progress could be tied to obtaining keys items that grant access to rooms necessary to beat the game?


Optional:

-Move Room generation methods into their own RoomRepository class
--MapRepository would be used soley for printing the map out on the console

-Add a toggle for displaying the controls at the top of the screen


Strech Goals:

-Add a Console.ForegroundColor property to the Block class
--Modify the map printing method to print blocks in that color when the map is printed
See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11150332/how-to-change-foreground-color-of-each-letter-in-a-string-in-c-sharp-console

-Try to get WallBlock class setup so walls can have a size other than 1x1 and print properly
--currently using Block class to place each interior wall individually
--map printing and player control methods will have to be significantly reworked
--all current maps will need to be edited to include a List<WallBlock> (currently commented out of the Room class)
--any maps that have interior walls should probably be reworked

-Add minigames for when you interact with certain objects
--Interacting with computers could bring up an ASCII computer monitor with a game inside that simulates coding
--An arcade cabinet that plays a mini game would be cool

-Add ASCII art to interactions with NPCs
--When you start a dialog the map is cleared and you just see an ASCII version
--of the back of the character's head and the front of the NPC's (as if they are facing eachother)
--Each time you make a selection the art is reprinted so the dialog is generated in chunks below it
